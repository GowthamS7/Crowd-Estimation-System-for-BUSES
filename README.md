# Crowd Management System using IoT - README

## Overview

The Crowd Management System is designed to address the challenges posed by the rapidly growing population in Indian metropolitan cities, specifically focusing on the efficient operation of public transport systems, particularly motorcars. The framework is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology, facilitating seamless communication between electronic devices to ensure effective crowd control and enhance public safety.

## Features

1. **Live Machine Position via GPS:**
   - The system provides real-time tracking of motorcars using GPS technology.
   - Users can easily determine the current position of the machine, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

2. **Crowd Position Monitoring:**
   - Utilizing advanced detectors, the system accurately monitors crowd levels within the motorcars.
   - This feature helps individuals make informed decisions about the crowdedness of the machine before deciding to travel.

3. **Efficient Crowd Data Collection:**
   - The detector layer is responsible for gathering precise crowd data within the motorcars.
   - It ensures high accuracy in estimating crowd density to facilitate effective crowd management.

4. **Smart Operations Interface:**
   - The framework employs a tidy and straightforward interface for easy operation.
   - Users of all ages can efficiently interact with the system, promoting widespread adoption and usability.

5. **Real-time Analysis and Alerts:**
   - The operation layer analyzes data flowing from detectors in real-time.
   - Managers receive alerts about crowded places, enabling them to take immediate and appropriate actions to alleviate crowd-related issues.

6. **Expansive Routes and Cost-Effective Travel:**
   - Motorcars remain the preferred mode of transportation due to their affordability and extensive route options.

## System Architecture

The Crowd Management System comprises three essential layers:

1. **Detector Layer:**
   - Gathers accurate crowd data within motorcars through advanced detectors.

2. **Operation Layer:**
   - Acts as a mediator between detectors and the interface layer.
   - Analyzes and processes data in real-time, alerting managers to crowded areas for timely interventions.

3. **Interface Layer:**
   - Presents information through a user-friendly interface.
   - Enables seamless communication between the system and end-users.
